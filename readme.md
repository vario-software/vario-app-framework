# VARIO App Framework

The VARIO App Framework makes it easy and quick to set up a VARIO Cloud App in Node.js by handling backend tasks like API communication, authentication, and providing useful built-in utilities. It also includes frontend assets with CSS and useful JavaScript utilities for app features and capabilities, giving the app a consistent look in the corporate design.

See the [VARIO App Demo](https://github.com/vario-software/vario-app-demo) built with this framework.
